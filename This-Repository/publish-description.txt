The "Dream Launcher" is a complete Launcher for The Sims 3. This is a Launcher developed to completely replace the game's original Launcher, developed by EA, in addition to being the "Dream Launcher" for every player who loves The Sims 3, just like me!

Although The Sims 3 is an incredible game, playing it today requires fixing a lot of things here and there, solve compatibility issues, bugs and other things. As a example, there is a bug where the game resets all your settings if you update your video card drivers. For those using an Intel 12th CPU or higher, the game won't even open. Not to mention all those performance issues and freezes.

The Dream Launcher was born with the aim of making the entire process of leaving your The Sims 3 in the most perfect state possible! Dream Launcher takes care of and manages your installation of The Sims 3 automatically, installing, updating and maintaining bug fixes, patches, graphical improvements and optimization, as well as giving you full control over every aspect of your game.

The goal of Dream Launcher is simple. You install your game clean. After that, all you need to do is install Dream Launcher. And that! With the Dream Launcher installed, The Sims 3 default Launcher will no longer open, but the Dream Launcher will. And with Dream Launcher you will NO longer need to mess with any game files, or spend hours on end installing patches, testing things, etc. You can have your game in the best possible state and ready to play in a few minutes and with a few clicks! Dream Launcher works as a ONE-STOP CENTER where you can do everything you want with your game. ENOUGH OF SUFFERING! :D

The installation process is very simple and easy! Except for the first step, but look... It will be so worth it! :)

[list]
[*] [b]1.[/b] It is mandatory that you uninstall your The Sims 3 from Steam. This is necessary to ensure a clean, functional and conflict-free installation for your game.
[*] [b]2.[/b] Delete the "The Sims 3" folder in "My Documents > Electronic Arts" on your computer. BUT remember to back up your Saves and Mods, as you can later import them into the game again, through the Dream Launcher!
[*] [b]3.[/b] Install The Sims 3 again on Steam as you would, but don't open it yet.
[*] [b]4.[/b] Download the Launcher ZIP file here at Nexus. The name should be something like "ts3-dream-launcher-X.X.X.zip".
[*] [b]5.[/b] On Steam, go to The Sims 3 page in your library. Then click "[Gear Icon] > Properties > Installed Files > Explore". The game's installation root folder will open in Files Explorer. Open the "Game" folder and then open the "Bin" folder.
[*] [b]6.[/b] Inside the "Bin" folder, search for "Sims3Launcher.exe" and rename it to "Sims3Launcher-backup.exe".
[*] [b]7.[/b] Inside the "Bin" folder, extract ALL the contents of file "ts3-dream-launcher-X.X.X.zip"" into this folder.
[*] [b]8.[/b] That is all!
[/list]

If you did everything correctly, now, when you click play The Sims 3 on Steam, the Dream Launcher will open, instead of the standard EA Launcher. The game hours should continue to be counted, perfectly, and everything should work normally. Just enjoy! :)

[b]NOTE:[/b] After installing Dream Launcher you should no longer do ANYTHING on your game files. Whether installing patches, Mods or anything similar. NOTHING. Leave these things to do ONLY through Dream Launcher! This will ensure that whatever needs to be done in your game, Dream Launcher will be aware of, and can take care of. Furthermore, basically everything you need to do in your game can be done using Dream Launcher! :)

[b]NOTE:[/b] If you get an ASI Loader related, error 126 on opening The Sims 3, it could mean that your computer is missing DLLs. Be sure to do all installations recommended on the "Patches" page within Dream Launcher.

Uninstalling Dream Launcher can be done in a simple way, returning to the "<game_directory>/Game/Bin" folder, deleting the "Sims3Launcher.exe" file and renaming the old "Sims3Launcher-backup.exe" file back to "Sims3Launcher.exe". Or if you prefer to delete Dream Launcher completely, you can redo the installation steps, but in reverse.
