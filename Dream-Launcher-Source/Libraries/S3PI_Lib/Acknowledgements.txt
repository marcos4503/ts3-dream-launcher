Acknowledgements for the s3pi library.

Code copyright for most of the code in the library is mine - Peter L Jones.
Exceptions to this are indicated in the source.

However, without the input from all the people who have contributed
knowledege about file formats - the Package and all the resources
contained in it - there would be no s3pi library.  There are two many people
to name them all but my thanks goes out to everyone who works on adding
to the wiki:

One name I have to mention specifically is Tiger, without whom the compression
code would still run incredibly slowly (and have errors).  Thanks for the code!

Atavera has written some additional wrappers, not currently included in the
s3pi binary distribution:
