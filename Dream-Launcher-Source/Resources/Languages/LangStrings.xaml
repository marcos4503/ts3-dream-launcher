    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch0_description">This Patch updates the "TS3W.exe" file to support processors with Intel's new BIG.little architecture. That is, 12th generation or newer processors. This patch can only be applied if you accept the patch dialog at the start of the Launcher.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch1_title">PT-PT to PT-BR Better Support</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch1_description">This Patch improves support for The Sims 3 for those who intend to play the game in PT-BR but the game still starts in PT-PT.

    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch3_title">Basic Optimization Patch</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch3_description">This Patch changes some of the game files and adds some optimization mods to your game. The mods added are as follows... The "NRaas - Master Controller". This mod does not do anything automatic in the game, however, it adds infinite control interactions in the game, such as resetting, editing or fixing objects or Sims. Adds better support for Slider mods and adds several optimization interactions to the game. This mod can be used for Cheating, but it's up to you to choose how to use it. The "Lazy Duchess - Smooth Patch". This mod adds several layers of optimization to the game and improves the loading speed of things in the game. "NRaas - GoHere" which adds improvements to the game's Sim routing system. The "Shimrod101 - Memories Disabled". This mod disables all memories (automatic and manual) in the game, which are a consistent source of in-game performance issues and save bloat. The "tuzlakserif232 - Hide EPs Game Icons". This mod hides the expansion icon in the furniture and clothing catalog. The "NRaas - Error Trap". This mod captures and corrects several technical errors that may arise during your gameplay. "NRaas - Overwatch". This mod automatically and periodically cleans your city, removing useless things and making the game more fluid. The "NRaas - Traffic". This mod has the ability to configure the number of vehicles and routing around the city, optimizing all of this. The "NRaas - Register". This mod adds the ability to limit animal types, sims, and spawn roles to optimize the population. And finally "NRaas - Traveler". This mod replaces the game's travel code, making it more optimized. ALL mods in this Patch are already pre-configured for the best performance.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch4_title">FPS Limiter Patch</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch4_description">Adds FPS Limiting Patching developed by "GriefReaper" to your game. After installing this Patch, the FPS limiting option in Dream Launcher settings will work. In game, use the "fps on" cheat to track the game's FPS.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch5_title">GPU and CPU Update Patch</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch5_description">This Patch updates the game's Hardware Database so that it can recognize newer GPUs and CPUs manufactured after 2013/2014. Furthermore, this Patch also updates the game's rules so that it can use as much hardware as possible, in addition to having access to more processing power at all times, regardless of settings. This Patch also prevents the game from limiting your hardware usage, due to the fact that it does not know the current CPU or GPU. After installing this Patch, run the game and go to the "The Sims 3" folder in your computer's Documents, then open the "DeviceConfig.log" file to see if the game now recognizes your hardware.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch6_title">Better Global Ilumination Patch</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch6_description">This Patch adds the mods "Lazy Duchess - Auto Lights Overhaul", "Boring Bones - Fixed Lightning" and "simsi45 - Improved Environmental Shadows". Together, these mods add a layer of improvement to the game's global and local lighting. The shadows are more beautiful, the color of the environment is more vivid and the lights in the rooms are now automatically turned off if no Sim is there. Adding up all these mods, there is an improvement in the game's graphics, making it visually smoother and more beautiful.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch7_title">Improved Shading Patch</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch7_description">This Patch adds the "Lazy Duchess - Pixel Shader Framework" to the game, and also adds the "Lazy Duchess - Shader Tweaks" to the game. With these Patches added, the game's Shading looks better as a whole. Glass will have better transparency, censorship pixels will look better, interior room lighting, facial lighting, Sims body hair and many other things will look better.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch8_title">Shadow Extender Patch</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch8_description">This Patch adds the "Lazy Duchess - Shadow Extender" to the game. This patch makes the game's shadows continue to be rendered even while in city view mode. For the shadows to be displayed, you need to increase the shadow quality here in the Launcher settings.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch9_title">Routing Optimizations Patch</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch9_description">This Patch adds a kit of mods that optimize Sims' routing in the game, reducing routing problems, improving the speed at which routes are calculated, etc. The mods added are... "bluegenjutsu - Faster Loading and Moving of the Elevators" which reduces the waiting time for elevators in Late Night EP. "bluegenjutsu - Better Routing for Game Objects" which improves routing for objects being fought over by Sims. "Twoftmama - Route Fix v9" which improves routing in general. "Nukael - No Motive Fail Tantrum or Whining" which removes tantrum animations while the Sim is in need, however, children still continue to throw tantrums. "stevebo77 - No Route Fail Tantrum" which removes tantrum animations when not finding a route to the destination. And finally "stevebo77 - No Foot Tapping" which removes the animation of the Sim tapping their foot while waiting for a route.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch10_title">Internet Removal Patch</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="launcher_patch10_description">This Patch prohibits The Sims 3 from connecting to the internet. This avoids delays in the game due to web requests, downloads of hundreds of unwanted files and even increases game performance and reduces RAM consumption in many cases. This patch will work even better if you disable "Online Notifications" and "Shop Mode". REQUIRES Windows Firewall enabled to work.</system:String>

in Presets and you can only change the life expectancy through these Presets. It is recommended that
you adjust according to the gameplay difficulty, so for example, if you installed mods to make the
game more difficult, earning less money for example, then your Sims will need longer lifespans so
that they don't spend all the time of life just working.

best choice for most players.
