# About this Software

This "The Sims 3 Dream Launcher" is a Launcher for The Sims 3 created by Marcos Tomaz, a fan of The Sims. This is a Launcher developed to completely replace the game's original Launcher, developed by EA, in addition to being the "Dream Launcher" for every player who loves The Sims 3, just like me.

Although The Sims 3 is an incredible game, playing it today requires fixing a lot of things here and there, solve compatibility issues or bugs and other things. For example, there is a bug where the game resets all your settings if you update your video card drivers. For those using an Intel 12th CPU or higher, the game won't even open. Not to mention all those performance issues and freezes.

Dream Launcher was born with the aim of making the entire process of leaving your The Sims 3 in the most perfect state possible! Dream Launcher takes care of and manages your installation of The Sims 3 automatically, installing, updating and maintaining bug fixes, patches, graphical improvements and optimization, as well as giving you full control over every aspect of your game. See below some of the main features of Dream Launcher...

- Fully supports EN-US and PT-BR languages as display languages.
- Automatically installs and maintains patches for fixes and enhancements.
- Fixes game compatibility issue with Intel 12th+ CPUs.
- Allows you to view your Saves.
- Allows you to clean your Save files to deflate them.
- Allows you to make automatic backups of your Saves.
- It has saved Sims management.
- Allows you to clear the game's cache easily.
- Allows you to manage and install optional improvement patches and corrections.
- It has an advanced and easy to use, built-in mod manager.
- Allows you to install and uninstall mods ("sims3pack" and "package") easily.
- It has a library of recommended mods that can be installed or uninstalled in a few clicks.
- It has an arsenal of popular tools for The Sims 3 players like "S3PE", "S3OC","Dashboard", "PackageViewer" and "Sims3MultiExtracter".
- Change your game settings through the Launcher.
- Change the game language easily.

And there are several other functions. Keep reading to find out how to install it!

    <b>If you want to use the Dream Launcher in your game, I highly recommend you download and follow the installation instructions from the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/thesims3/mods/155" target="_blank">Dream Launcher page on Nexus Mods</a>!</b>

# To use this Software

It is <b>MANDATORY</b> that you uninstall your The Sims 3, install it again from scratch, and then install the Dream Launcher following the procedures below. This is necessary to ensure a clean, functional and conflict-free installation for your game. <b>If you have mods installed</b> in your game, it is MANDATORY that you delete the "Mods" folder from your "The Sims 3" folder in "My Documents" on your computer. This is necessary because Dream Launcher will now control and format your game Mods! If you want to install the Mods you had before, save them and install them through the Launcher once you have it installed it. If you've already done all of this, then continue...

<b>1.</b> To start, download this repository by cloning the "Dream-Launcher-Compiled" folder to your computer. After that, copy ALL the content inside the "Dream-Launcher-Compiled" folder. 

<b>2.</b> Go to your The Sims 3 installation root directory and access the "Game/Bin" folder. Rename the file "Sims3Launcher.exe" to "Sims3Launcher-backup.exe".

<b>3.</b> Now, paste ALL the copied content into this folder.

That is all! If you did everything correctly, now, when you click play The Sims 3 on Steam, the Dream Launcher will open, instead of the standard EA Launcher. The game hours should continue to be counted and everything should work normally. Just enjoy! :)

<b>NOTE:</b> After installing Dream Launcher you should no longer do ANYTHING on your game files. Whether installing patches, mods or anything similar. NOTHING. Leave these things to do ONLY through Dream Launcher!
