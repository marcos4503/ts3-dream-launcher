# ts3-dream-launcher
This "The Sims 3 Dream Launcher" is a Launcher for The Sims 3 created by Marcos Tomaz, a fan of The Sims. The Launcher fixes and maintains active fixes for several known game issues, replaces the game's problematic default launcher and even has a built-in mod manager. There are lots of other things too! :)
