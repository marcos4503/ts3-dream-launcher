# About this Software

This "The Sims 3 Dream Launcher" is a Launcher for The Sims 3 created by Marcos Tomaz, a fan of The Sims. This is a Launcher developed to completely replace the game's original Launcher, developed by EA, in addition to being the "Dream Launcher" for every player who loves The Sims 3, just like me.

Although The Sims 3 is an incredible game, playing it today requires fixing a lot of things here and there, solve compatibility issues or bugs and other things. For example, there is a bug where the game resets all your settings if you update your video card drivers. For those using an Intel 12th CPU or higher, the game won't even open. If you are a gamer who likes to play with mods to deepen the gameplay or change things in the game, then everything becomes 5 times more complicated.

Dream Launcher was born with the aim of making the entire process of leaving your The Sims 3 in the most perfect state possible! Dream Launcher takes care of and manages your installation of The Sims 3 automatically, installing, updating and maintaining bug fixes, patches, graphical improvements and optimization, as well as giving you full control over every aspect of your game. See below some of the main features of Dream Launcher...
